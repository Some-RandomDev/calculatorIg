Ok so this started off as a school project  
Our class was tasked with creating an extremly simple cli calculator which will add 2 numbers  
We decided we'll make it slightly more advanced than that  
So, here we are, creating an extremely simple calculator, capable of performing simple arethamatic on any number of operands (atleast that's what's planned)  
So far, I've written the GUI, and a simple script to convert the given string into a list of operands and operators  
> (Also nasa waale bohot khatarnak hai)
# Where to write the function to operate
Add it in the Calc() function of bohot khatarnak hai.py  
Also edit the function as necessary  
and return the final result after operating  
...please I'm counting on you
