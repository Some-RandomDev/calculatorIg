Ok so this started off as a school project  
Our class was tasked with creating an extremly simple cli calculator which will add 2 numbers  
We decided we'll make it slightly more advanced than that  
So, here we are, creating an extremely simple calculator, capable of performing simple arethamatic on any number of operands.
This will slowly get updated with more and more operations... ig
